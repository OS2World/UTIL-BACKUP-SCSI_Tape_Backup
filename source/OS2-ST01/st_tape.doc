ST01 setup:
-----------

See ST01FIX.TXT for necessary hardware fixes. An unpatched ST01 will
not work with the Tandberg series 3600 tape drives. Some ST01 version
do not have the interrupt jumper installed, since DOS does not require
interrupts. This driver *does* require interrupts. It might be wise to
install the termination resistors too, although it might be sufficient
to have a termination on one side (the drive) only, if the cable is
short.

Interrupt:	5
ST01 SCSI ID:	6
Tape SCSI ID:	4

These values are defined near the top of ST_IO.ASM.

Source code layout and possible modifications:
----------------------------------------------

makefile.mk:	For DMake.

		SCSI_LVL=0	Tandberg's non-standard Request Sense block
		SCSI_LVL=1	Standard Request Sense block layout.

defs.inc:	trace=0 completely disables debugging trace.
		trace=1 generates MDA debugging display, which can be
		controlled by DosDevIOCtl calls.

debug.inc/asm:	Device driver debugging helpers for output on
		monochrome(!) card.

st_tape.asm:	High level device driver interface

st_io.asm:	Low level ST01 input/output

	EnableFast	If the driver hangs your system when used, set
			this constant to 0 to relax the critical i/o
			timing. If it works now (probably very slow),
			try to fine-tune the corresponding fast-I/O
			loops/block-transfers (see below).

	EnableBlock	If set to 1, maximum-speed block transfers are
			used for data transfer. This proved unusable in
			a 486 system, but might be reliable on 386
			systems. If set to 0, the transfer timing is
			somewhat relaxed, suitable for at least one
			486-33MHz system.

			The critical code for EnableFast and EnableBlock
			is located behind the labels "x_fast_in:" and
			"x_fast_out:".

	PhysIO		Physical address of the ST01 I/O ports. In a
			ST01 equipped with 8KB ROMs this should be set
			to the ROM base address + 1A00h. While I know
			there are cards equipped with 16KB ROMs, I
			have not seen such a beast yet. You have to
			look for the addresses yourself, but probably
			the I/O addresses are at ROM-base + 3A00h.

	IRQnum		The interrupt number to which the ST01 is
			connected.

	TargetID	The SCSI ID of the streamer.

Implemented char device driver functions:
-----------------------------------------

	Read
	Write
	IOCtl

Since reads and writes are checked for transfer lengths of a multiple
of 512, it is not possible to access the drive in DOS mode (DOS mode
transfers 1 byte at a time). Likewise it is usually not possible to copy
a file to the device (the last block will most likely fail). Use the
tape utility instead.

Read/Write command return codes:
--------------------------------

EOF (0 bytes):		- Filemark detected.

Change disk:		- Unit attention. Reported on the next command
			following a power-up, reset or media change.

Character I/O call	- The operation was interrupted due to signal
interrupted:		(Ctrl-C/Break), process death or the like.

Read fault:		- Reached logical EOM.

Write fault:		- Reached physical EOM.
			- A write operation was attempted in a position
			between BOT and logical EOM.

Not ready:		- Drive reports "not ready", "not loaded",
			"hardware error" or bus parity error.
			- Drive reports reservation conflict.
			- Drive did not respond to abort or reset 
			message request (triggers bus reset).

CRC error:		- Bad block (read, verify).
			- Uncorrectable data error (write).
			- Compare operation failed (verify).

Sector not found:	- No data on the media.

Write proteced:		- Media is write-protected.

General failure:	- Driver error. Usually due to bus phase 
			sequencing timeout.
			- The specified CDB or data length differs
			from the length expected by the target.

Invalid command:	- Invalid IOCtl code.
			- Invalid SCSI command.

Unknown media:		- Command received "check condition" status but
			the "request sense" command failed or returned
			an unknown error code.

Invalid parameter:	- R/W data length not a multiple of 512 (DOS mode).
			IOCtl pointer validation check failed.


IOCtl commands:
---------------

Category 11, function 01h:	Flush input buffer.

	Ignored.

Category 11, function 02h:	Flush output buffer.

	Ignored.

Category 11, function 41h:	Session switch notification.

	Ignored.

Category 11, function 60h:	Query monitor support.

	Returns "monitor calls not supported".

Category 80h, function 0:	SCSI command, slow data transfer.
Category 80h, function 1:	SCSI command, fast data transfer.

	Parameter block is SCSI CDB (command descriptor block)
	(read-only). Data block is SCSI data transfer block
	(read-write). Since the length specifications of the 
	parameter and data areas are required, you have to use 
	DevIOCtl2. If there is no data transfer, the data pointer
	must be 0.

	If the command fails, the status byte is returned as 
	"user defined error code" (0FF02h for "check status"). 
	There is no implied REQUEST SENSE command.
-->	BUG: The current version never return 0FF02. Always
	issue REQEST SENSE after an IOCtl CDB command.

	The "fast data transfer" function is only to be used for
	SCSI commands with high speed block transfer. Commands
	with delays between successive bytes might give	unexpec-
	ted results or might even crash the system. The fast data 
	transfer mode waits for new data every 512 bytes. It 
	should not be used for operations other than standard
	read or write - even the "inquiry" command is a slow
	command on Tandberg 3600. Additionally it requires the
	tape block size to be a multiple of 512.

Category 80h, function 2:	Bus reset.

	Resets the SCSI bus and all connected devices.
	Parameter and data block is neither checked nor used.

Category 80h, function 3:	Device reset.

	Resets the target device only.
	Parameter and data block is neither checked nor used.

Category 80h, function 4:	Set trace level.

	Parameter block is a single byte containing the trace level.
	Trace output is written directly to MPA/MGA screen at
	physical address 0B0000h.
	0	= no trace
	1	= errors only
	2	= individual commands
	3-20	= the higher the level the more detailed the trace

	The trace code is currently disabled. To enable the trace 
	code, set TRACE=1 (or whatever non-zero trace level you 
	want as default) in DEFS.INC and reassemble all modules.

Special IOCtl command return codes:
-----------------------------------

0xFF00..0xFF13	Standard device driver error code.
0xFF80..0xFFFF	SCSI status byte.
		0xFF82 = check status (request sense command required)
		0xFF88 = device busy
		0xFF98 = reservation conflict

SCSI standard considerations:
-----------------------------

The driver is built for the Trandberg TDC 3600 series tape drives.
These drives do NOT conform to SCSI-1: The error codes within the
REQUEST SENSE data are placed at offsets 14+15 instead of 12+13.
However, the mechanically indentical IBM RS/6000 tape drive 7207-001
conforms to SCSI-1 (in this respect). To enable a SCSI-1 conformant
error detection, set SCSI_LVL=1 within MAKEFILE.MK and reassemble
ST_TAPE.ASM.
